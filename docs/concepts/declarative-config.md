# Declarative Configuration in Sushi Gateway

Sushi Gateway is designed with a stateless, declarative configuration approach, enabling flexibility and simplicity for various deployment scenarios. All configurations are provided through declarative files, such as config.json. This method eliminates the need for a database, making it ideal for:

- Testing and development environments.
- Production environments with static, version-controlled configurations.
- Scenarios where infrastructure automation (e.g., GitOps) is preferred.
