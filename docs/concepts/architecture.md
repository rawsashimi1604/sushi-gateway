# Sushi Gateway Architecture

Sushi Gatewayâ€™s architecture is designed for flexibility, modularity, and scalability. It provides a robust API gateway solution that can handle diverse workloads and use cases. Below, we explore the core components and networking of Sushi Gateway.

## Core Components

### 1. Sushi Proxy

The Sushi Proxy is the core component responsible for:

- **Routing**: Directing requests to the appropriate upstream services based on defined configurations.
- **Load Balancing**: Distributing requests across multiple service instances using strategies like round-robin.
- **Plugin Management**: Executing configured plugins for authentication, rate limiting, and request transformation.

### 2. Sushi Manager

Sushi Manager is a web-based user interface that simplifies:

- **Configuration Management**: Visualize and modify gateway configurations.
- **Monitoring**: Track API usage and inspect logs in real-time.
- **Testing**: Quickly test routes and plugins through the interactive UI.


## Plugins and Extensibility

Sushi Gateway adopts a modular approach with plugins to extend functionality. Some functionalities of plugins include:

- **Authenticate Requests**: Support JWT, API keys, MTLS, and more.
- **Rate Limit Traffic**: Control the number of requests per user or service.

### Plugin Scopes

Plugins can be applied at different scopes, allowing fine-grained customizability:

| Scope       | Description                                    |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Global**  | Applies policies across all services.          |
| **Service** | Applies policies to specific backend services. |
| **Route**   | Tailors policies for individual API routes.    |

## Networking and Ports

| Port | Protocol | Purpose                                                               |
| ---- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 8008 | HTTP     | Exposes the API Gateway for client requests.                          |
| 8443 | HTTPS    | Provides secure communication using TLS.                              |
| 8081 | HTTP     | Hosts the internal Admin API for managing and querying gateway state. |
| 5173 | HTTP     | Runs the web-based UI for interacting with Sushi Gateway.             |

::: tip
Ensure the appropriate ports are open in your firewall or networking settings for smooth operation.
